R is described as  "a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics" at the [R project for Statistical Computing](https://www.r-project.org/).  For me the strength of R is not only as a programming language but also a powerful statistical computing system, it is powerful, relatively easy to use for statistical analysis and has excellent facilities to easily produce publication quality plots.

Coming from a background in pure mathematics, my first exposure to coding and software development was in MatLab, MAGMA and GAP.  I later branched out into C, C++ and Python.  My exposure to MAGMA and GAP was mainly in algebraic and combinatoric algorithms, but it was in R that I first really got to grips with statistical computing.  Over the years I have written several R packages for data visualisation tools, tools to analyse electronic health data, and developed highly optimized R packages providing statistical machine learning algorithms for the analysis of large scale single cell RNA-seq datasets.  I have optimized my R code extensively, integrated C++ code, made use of Rmarkdown (and now quarto) for data analysis and building websites, and it is still my primary tool for data visualisation.  I have also taught students to use R over several years, so hopefully the resources I point to here will be useful.

## Free Resources

### Software Development and Data Science

Hadley Wickham and the posit team have produced some excellent resources, which tend to promote their tidyverse tooling.

- [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/): The introductory book from Hadley Wickham, an excellent resource for beginners and intermediate users alike.
- [R packages](https://r-pkgs.org/): Hadley WIckham and Jennifer Bryan's excellent introduction to building R packages.
- [Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/): An advanced book from Hadley Wickham - I thoroughly enjoyed it, the content is excellent and well written, but is for established R users.

Roger Peng has produced a handy book re. software development in R.  This is excellent if you're serious about developing packages, but may not be for you if you are mostly interested in analysis.

- [Mastering Software Development with R](https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/RProgDA/): a very useful book from Roger Peng and others.

Rafael Irizarry has also written two introductory courses, which start from scratch but equip you to carry out many statistical analyses in R.

- [Data Analysis for the Life Sciences](https://github.com/genomicsclass/labs?tab=readme-ov-file): a useful introductory book from Rafael Irizarry
- [Introduction to Data Science: Data Analysis and Prediction Algorithms with R](https://rafalab.dfci.harvard.edu/dsbook/): another book from Rafael Irizarry

Robin Evans' University of Oxford [Statistical Computing course](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~evans/statprog/index2.htm)

### Integrating C++ with R through Rcpp

- [Rcpp](https://www.rcpp.org/)
- [Rcpp gallery](https://gallery.rcpp.org/)

### Visualisation

- [Introduction to ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/articles/ggplot2.html): an introduction to ggplot2 from the tidyverse team
- [An introduction to ggplot2](https://www.datanovia.com/en/lessons/introduction-to-ggplot2/): a useful introduction with examples.
- [Fundamentals of Data Visualisation](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/) an excellent introduction from cowplot developer Claus O. Wilke
- [ggplot2 book](https://ggplot2-book.org/introduction.html) : not the best place to start for beginners, but worth reading once familiar with the basics (if you are a beginner, stick to R for Data Science for the basics).

### Other useful resources

- [The R blog](https://blog.r-project.org/) for discussions about upcoming features in R.  Probably for advanced users.
- [R Manuals](https://cran.r-project.org/manuals.html) Again, this is rather a lot of detail if you are starting out, but for an advanced user it can be a useful resource.
- [Writing R extensions](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html) This is an excellent resource once you're established with building R packages.  To get started I recommend the book by Hadley Wickham and Jennifer Bryan linked above.

Several of these links I return to time and time again, so I am sure I will return to this page to dig them out in the near future.
