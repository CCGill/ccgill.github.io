    "text": "This post is intended to give a short practical example of using two widely used methods, conda and docker, to use bioinformatics tools while avoiding much of the overhead of installing and compiling them. I have used conda for a little under a decade and got started with docker a few years ago. Hopefully this post can serve as a practical example for those getting started with these approaches. I’ve included docker here as it is extremely efficient, containerization is more and more widely used, and integrated into many workflow management tools 1.\nI find tools like conda, pyenv, pip, venv, rig, and renv are all excellent for environment management. They all have strengths, limitations, and a learning curve, but quickly become part of your day-to-day tooling. However, the problem remains that sometimes you are at the start of a new project, or worse halfway through an existing project and you need to install a new tool - this new tool may have new dependencies, require compilation, and may well share dependencies with existing tools, potentially with different versions.\nThere are many solutions to this - one I have seen several resort to is a conda environment per tool, to ensure dependencies are handled independently (note, this can be difficult to manage effectively and collaborate with - the overhead for setting up a working environment increases significantly). Whether you use a separate environment for each tool or not, using conda is effective and I will give some basic commands to get started in the first part of this post. An alternative approach is to use pre-built docker containers, which I will demonstrate in the second half of this post."

I have used the above setup on my personal notebook and also on remote compute environments when working in the cloud. In comparison to the past manual setup and management, this is a much better user experience. However, conda environments are somewhat slow to setup, in comparison to containerized solutions (see later).\n\n\nReproducing your results: recreating your conda environment\nNote: if you, or a colleague/collaborator, later want to recreate an environment to rerun an analysis, you can do so using the environment.yml. The following command: conda env create -f environment.yml will recreate the environment. This is a really powerful tool for creating portable environments, and enabling reproducible research."

    "section": "Docker and biocontainers: running bcftools as a container",
    "text": "Docker and biocontainers: running bcftools as a container\nIn some cases tools are already available from public container repositories - a good example of this is bcftools in the biocontainers container registry - if you read the documentation you will see that biocontainers is tightly tied to bioconda, but I’ll leave that to the reader to look into and here I’ll focus on the practical steps to use the tool.\nAfter selecting a docker container version from the bcftools page, it can be run as follows (we have chosen the image quay.io/biocontainers/bcftools:1.21--h8b25389_0):\n\ndocker pull quay.io/biocontainers/bcftools:1.21--h8b25389_0\ndocker run quay.io/biocontainers/bcftools:1.21--h8b25389_0 bcftools --version\n\nNote that after the docker run &lt;image&gt;, the command starts that you want to run in the shell. This is a common pattern.\nIf you are familiar with docker and containerization then you will be aware that this has executed a command in an isolated container on your local machine. Container resources do not automatically scale to your system resources, there are usually limits enforced by the docker client. You will need to manage allowed resources, for instance memory limits, via the docker client on your machine to ensure that enough memory is made available (for Mac and Windows you can do this via the docker desktop client).\nTo make use of this tooling then, we need to ensure the input and output directories are mounted to the container. This is done with a -v local-path:container-path argument to the container, mounting the local directory (specified here as local-path to the directory in the container container-path).\nIn its simplest form, to run a command in a docker container on the current working directory, we can mount the working directory as follows:\n\ndocker run -v \"${PWD}:/tmp/\" quay.io/biocontainers/bcftools:1.21--h8b25389_0 ls /tmp/\n\nNote that this is not running bcftools, it is running the command ls /tmp/ on an isolated (containerized) linux OS running on the local machine. If you run this command you will see a list of the files in the current working directory. Since bcftools is installed and in the path on the container, you can run bcftools on files in your working directory as below. In this example, we list the samples in a vcf file in the current working directory.\n\ndocker run \\\n    -v \"${PWD}:/tmp/\" \\\n    quay.io/biocontainers/bcftools:1.21--h8b25389_0 \\\n    bcftools query -l /tmp/test-file-chr22.vcf.gz &gt; /tmp/sample-id-list.txt\n\nThe command bcftools query -l /tmp/test-file-chr22.vcf.gz &gt; /tmp/sample-id-list.txt will have written the list of sample IDs to a file sample-id-list.txt to the /tmp/ directory on the container, so that now exists on your machine in the current working directory.\nNow, to understand this a little better: ${PWD} contains the path to you working directory (if you’re not familiar with this, type echo \"${PWD}\" into the command line and it will print the path to your current directory, usually achieved with pwd). We can thus generalize the above to mount any directory to the docker container. If you wanted to mount an input and an output directory, you could do this as follows:\n\ndocker run \\\n    -v \"/path/to/input/directory:/tmp/input/\" \\\n    -v \"/path/to/output/directory:/tmp/output/\" \\\n    quay.io/biocontainers/bcftools:1.21--h8b25389_0 \\\n    bcftools query -l /tmp/input/test-file-chr22.vcf.gz &gt; /tmp/output/sample-id-list.txt\n\nNotice that we have mounted the input directory to /tmp/input and the output directory to /tmp/output. These are updated accordingly in the bcftools command that is being run on the container.\n\nReproducing your results:\nOne major advantage of using docker containers is that you can simply rerun the commands to pull the same image and run the same commands. Two key points stand out:\n\nmake sure you script the commands you use, and\nbe wary of the latest tag: this is great for exploratory work but, as the name suggests, points to the latest version of the container image, and this will change over time."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Since I’m returning to blogging after a number of years, I thought as a first post I’d start with a tool I recently wrote to address something I consider fundamental, but which I frequently find myself advocating for and providing training in - reproducibility in research1.\nThis will be a short post as, more specifically, I’ll briefly discuss a useful script I recently developed to setup an R analysis project with renv. The only requirement is a functioning R installation and jupyter-client.\nThe key reason for developing this script is to automate:\n\ncreation of a common project folder structure.\ncreation of an renv environment ready to use.\ninstallation of an R jupyter kernel ready for use.\n\nWhile this is a good start, it’s important to note that renv does not cover all aspects of reproducibility - some caveats are noted in the renv documentation, but critically if used correctly it does capture package dependency versions and the R version. Since I now frequently manage cloud compute environments using infrastructure-as-code tools such as terraform, and I can define start-up scripts to install dependencies such as R versions, this script is sufficient for reproducibility.\nThe script requires a kernel-name and project folder location as arguments and carries out the following steps:\n\nConstructs an analysis-ready folder structure. This is quite opinionated, but it has proven useful:\n\n/path/to/project/directory/\n├── data\n│   ├── 00_source\n│   ├── 01_staging\n│   └── 02_final\n├── figures\n├── notebooks\n└── output\n    ├── data\n    ├── figures\n    └── other\n\nInitialises an renv environment in the project root directory.\nInstalls the IRkernel package and installs the corresponding kernel for the user.\nCreates an R script to reinstall the kernel for the user in the notebooks folder.\nEnsures the renv environment is active in the notebooks directory. This is achieved by creating a particular .Rprofile file.\n\nThe final project directory structure is as follows (having removed all of the additional files installed in the renv/ folder):\n/path/to/project/directory/\n├── data\n│   ├── 00_source\n│   ├── 01_intermediate\n│   └── 02_processed\n├── figures\n├── notebooks\n│   └── 00-install-kernel.R\n├── output\n│   ├── data\n│   ├── figures\n│   └── other\n├── renv/...\n└── renv.lock\nI have found such a structure useful as it ensures\n\nEase of use for others:\n\nPerhaps most importantly it is portable, this project can be handed to another user/colleague and it is relatively easy to understand, assuming your code is well-written and naming conventions are sensible - this may be the subject of another post 2.\nHaving introduced a similar setup script like this to others, I have found it eases the transition from writing R code to creating reproducible analyses. This is particularly true for those new to computational analysis or those who are not computational scientists and engineers.\n\n\n\nEase of use for me:\n\nThe existence of the folders is a useful reminder how to keep the output and working files organised.\nThe only rule the user needs to remember is to keep all running code in the notebooks directory and to run renv::snapshot() periodically.\nThis is much faster than conda, and after both my own experience and supporting several users using conda, I have found the conda dependency management for R packages to be unreliable at times.\n\n\nThe immediate availability of the jupyter kernel is another key efficiency here, following project setup I can immediately open jupyter notebooks with the relevant R kernel in the notebooks directory.\nNote that it can also be extended to python virtual environments or conda managed python by keeping all environment configuration in the root directory (for example requirements.txt/environment.yml files, venv folders).\n\n\nThis was both the biggest surprise when I started using renv, and the trickiest part to get right in this project structure. As noted, I have configured this script to ensure that any R session started in the notebooks folder will use the renv stored in the root directory. This is not the case out-of-the-box with renv, but is enabled by creating a .Rprofile file in the notebooks directory containing the following line (as described in a GitHub issue here):\nowd &lt;- setwd(\"..\"); source(\"renv/activate.R\"); setwd(owd)\nWhen activated, the renv configuration must be stored in the working directory - this .Rprofile changes the working directory to enable the activation. The .Rprofile file is run when an R session is started (see here for more details about renv, and good pointers to the flexible but relatively complex configuration options for R). This file essentially changes the working directory to the root (parent) directory, activates the renv R environment there, and changes directory back to the notebooks directory again.\nI hope this script is useful to others - it has proven invaluable for me, and I expect to optimize it and add more features/options in future. It is publicly available on GitHub here."

However, computational reproducibility is essential for the credibility of results - if you can’t reproduce your computational results from the source data, you should not trust them or publish them. This has a strong implication for record-keeping, and version control for both code and datasets.↩︎\nRegarding naming conventions - personally I name wrapper scripts/notebooks/workflows with zero-padded integers followed by meaningful names to ensure it is clear in which order they are run, and place utility scripts and executables in a bin/ folder. I use linters for R code and linters and autoformatters (usually black or ruff) for python. I prefer to use a coding standard, both for consistency, and to ensure that my focus is on code content. For R I (and Google) recommend the tidyverse code style. If you’re not familiar with these, it may be worth reading the tidyverse style guide and Google’s additions.↩︎"

I later branched out into C, C++ and Python. My exposure to MAGMA and GAP was mainly in algebraic and combinatoric algorithms, but it was in R that I first really got to grips with statistical computing. Over the years I have written several R packages for data visualisation tools, tools to analyse electronic health data, and developed highly optimized R packages providing statistical machine learning algorithms for the analysis of large scale single cell RNA-seq datasets. I have optimized my R code extensively, integrated C++ code, made use of Rmarkdown (and now quarto) for data analysis and building websites, and it is still my primary tool for data visualisation. I have also taught students to use R over several years, so hopefully the resources I point to here will be useful."

This is excellent if you’re serious about developing packages, but may not be for you if you are mostly interested in analysis.\n\nMastering Software Development with R: a very useful book from Roger Peng and others."

    "text": "Introductory books/courses\nThe excellent R for Data Science book referenced above is one of many good introductory books and courses available, all of which have a different perspective.\nThe following books start more or less “from scratch”, so are excellent if you’re just getting started.\n\nData Analysis for the Life Sciences: a useful introductory book from Rafael Irizarry\nIntroduction to Data Science: Data Analysis and Prediction Algorithms with R: another book from Rafael Irizarry\nExploratory Data Analysis with R Roger Peng’s introductory book on exploratory data analysis. Some of the chapters are a little brief, but it has several good starting points.\n\nRobin Evans’ University of Oxford Statistical Computing course\n\nIntegrating C++ with R through Rcpp\nIn some cases, optimizing your R code can only go so far, and some lower-level programming is required. I’ve found the Rcpp suite of packages very helpful in automating the build and bindings to expose C++ code in my R packages. Particularly Rcpp, RcppArmadillo and RcppEigen.\n\nRcpp\nRcpp gallery\n\n\n\nVisualisation\nR is capable of producing beautiful publication-ready figures. While I don’t subscribe to the notion that one tool is inherently better than any others, I find the ggplot2 library and in particular the grammar of graphics expressive and efficient. This is particularly helpful during exploratory analyses, helping to iterate quickly.\n\nIntroduction to ggplot2: an introduction to ggplot2 from the tidyverse team\nAn introduction to ggplot2: a useful introduction with examples.\nFundamentals of Data Visualisation an excellent introduction from cowplot developer Claus O. Wilke\nggplot2 book : not the best place to start for beginners, but worth reading once familiar with the basics (if you are a beginner, stick to R for Data Science for the basics).\nR graph gallery this is an excellent resource, particulary when getting started.\n\n\n\nCode Style\n\nThe tidyverse style guide Personally, I have found this an excellent resource, and comparison with the Google style guide was time well-spent.\n\n\n\nOther useful resources\n\nThe Arrow R cookbook an excellent cookbook of approaches to use arrow tooling in R.\nR Manuals Again, this is rather a lot of detail if you are starting out, but for an advanced user it can be a useful resource.\nWriting R extensions This is an excellent resource once you’re established with building R packages. To get started I recommend the book by Hadley Wickham and Jennifer Bryan linked above.\n\n\n\nSelected blogs and resources\n\nThe R blog for discussions about upcoming features in R. Probably for advanced users.\n\nSeveral of these links I return to time and time again, so I am sure I will return to this page to dig them out in the near future."

However, I rely on bookmarks and google far too much to find resources, so this post is intended to enable me and hopefully others to find some useful references.\nI was fortunate to work in the labs of Jonathan Marchini and Simon Myers on some aspects of population genetics and functional genomics. This post will focus on genetics resources, and initially mostly population genetics. As I have very limited time today I will add just a few free learning resources from population genetics and will later update with some of the others I have planned."

I really appreciated the coverage of many aspects of the subject that are “well known”, and therefore no longer referenced, but often difficult to pin down for newcomers to the field1.\n\nThe Coop lab blog\n\n\nJonathan Pritchard’s An Owner’s Guide to the Human Genome: an introduction to human population genetics, variation and disease - an excellent resource from Jonathan Pritchard. The Pritchard lab page is well worth a visit.\n\nWhen I have time I will add in a recommended reading list of books I have enjoyed and that give a good grounding in population genetics, both empirical and theoretical."

    "text": "Footnotes\n\n\nI think everyone who has worked in research and had to find their way around a new field will be familiar with this - that when a concept or technique is well-known enough it is no longer referenced in the literature (except PhD Theses or occasionally survey papers). The challenge is to discern when a concept is well-known enough that it no longer requires explanation or referencing in new publications. This is even more of a challenge in interdisciplinary work in which collaborating scientists have differing views of what is “well-known”.↩︎"
